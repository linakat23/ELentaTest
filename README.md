# ELentaTest
elenta.lt is an open platform that allows users to create accounts (optional) and post ads for free. 
I've tested 3 main functionalities, namely registration, log in and ad creation, including file upload.
Project mainly consists of RegisterTest, LoginTest and AdCreationTest classes, all of which contain positive and negative tests, and two object classes called User and Ad. 
Additionally 3 XML files were created to enable different tests from multiple sources.
